The objective of the current project is to explore a simple application of Airflow within a machine learning pipeline, leveraging a project developed by Priyank Sanghvi published in Kaggle website [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/priyanksanghvitech/satellite-image-classification-using-cnn). The ML project's primary goal is to train and test a Convolutional Neural Netwrok (CNN) model for classify satellite images using Pytorch. In this context, I delve into Airflow functionalities, such as Connections and Hooks, as well as utilize other Python libraries and tecnologies, such as PostgreSQL, AWS' Simple Storage System (S3), Metabase and Docker containers. Additionally, I briefly explore the utilization of GPU by PyTorch within a container.
